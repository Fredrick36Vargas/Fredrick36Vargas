## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a junior full-stack developer building end-to-end web applications using Django on the backend and React on the frontend. This repository is part of my learning journey, where I bring together both sides of the stack to create functional, user-friendly, and scalable applications.

On the backend, I use Django to handle core business logic, database interactions, and RESTful APIs. Iâ€™m learning how to design models, write clean and reusable views, and structure secure APIs using Django REST Framework. Djangoâ€™s batteries-included approach makes it a powerful tool for building reliable backends quickly, while still encouraging best practices like modular code, reusability, and testing.

On the frontend, I use React to build responsive and interactive user interfaces. Iâ€™m exploring component-based design, hooks, state management, and routing to create seamless user experiences that connect directly to the Django API layer. I also enjoy working with modern styling solutions like Tailwind CSS and integrating third-party libraries for UI components.

This repository includes full-stack projects that cover everything from user authentication and CRUD functionality to API integration and deployment setups. Each project is designed to help me improve my skills in connecting the frontend and backend, handling real-world data, and delivering complete application workflows.

Iâ€™m also exploring deployment tools, environment management, and version control practices to build confidence in delivering production-ready apps.

If youâ€™re also working with Django and React or exploring full-stack development, feel free to explore the code, share feedback, or connect. Iâ€™m always open to learning and collaborating with others in the community.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”and hereâ€™s to building complete, full-stack applications, one feature at a time.
